1. Is replay configured correctly?
   The number of cars must be n:
     $ ./replay -n logs/logfile
2. Is src/RSTC/Cars.hs configured correctly?
   'cars' must be the cars that occur in the observations.
3. Are TTCs enabled in RSTC.BAT.Base.match?
   Sometimes (probably oscillating) TTCs lead to match failure.
